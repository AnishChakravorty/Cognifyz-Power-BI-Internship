# Cognifyz-Power-BI-Internship
Create a comprehensive investment dashboard incorporating all insights.

## Task 1: Data Exploration and Summary

### Objective: Understand and summarize key statistics in the dataset.

➤ 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: The journey began with importing the dataset into Power BI, laying the foundation for a comprehensive analysis. This versatile tool proved invaluable for managing and dissecting the information at hand.

➤ 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: With the data loaded, I conducted a thorough exploration to grasp its intricacies. This critical phase involved scrutinizing data structures and types, enabling me to pinpoint key variables and ensure the analysis would be both accurate and meaningful.

➤ 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬: Leveraging insights from the examination phase, I proceeded to calculate pivotal statistics. This included determining the average age of participants, quantifying investment preferences, and identifying prevalent savings goals and some additional insights done by me to make it more relevant. These derived metrics offered a great understanding of the dataset's core characteristics.

➤ 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: To transform raw data into compelling insights, I crafted a suite of dynamic visualizations. These carefully designed charts and graphs serve as powerful tools, making complex data patterns accessible and facilitating intuitive interpretation for viewers.

Insights from Report :-

- The average age of individuals in the dataset is 28 years.
- There are 40 investment avenues and 40 stock market options available.
- Gold is the most popular investment choice at 21.34%, followed closely by Debentures at 20.54%.
- Males have a higher rate of investment (25) compared to females (15).
- The majority of investors (72.5%) monitor their investments monthly, with 17.5% checking weekly and 10% daily.
- Capital appreciation is the most common savings objective (26), followed by growth (11) and income (3).
- For individual savings objectives, retirement plans are the top priority (24), followed by health care (13) and education (3).
- The data shows a diverse range of investment preferences, with Government Bonds, Fixed Deposits, and Equity Markets also being significant choices.
- PPF (Provident Fund) is the least popular investment option at 7.23%.

## Task 2: Gender-based Analysis

Objective: To create insightful visualizations that highlight how investment choices vary between genders.

My approach:

• Data Exploration: I began by thoroughly examining the dataset to understand the various investment options and gender distribution.

• Visualization Strategy: After careful consideration, I decided to use a combination of clustered and stacked column charts to effectively showcase the differences.

• Chart Creation: Using Power BI, I designed charts comparing investment preferences for equity, mutual funds, and government bonds across genders.

• Analysis: I spent time analyzing the visualizations to identify notable trends and differences in investment behavior between male and female investors.

Key Learnings:

- Improved my data preprocessing skills.
- Enhanced my ability to choose appropriate chart types for specific data comparisons.
- Gained insights into gender-based financial decision-making patterns.

Key Inisghts:

1. Investment Preferences:

- Males prefer government bonds (121) over equity (89) and mutual funds (61).
- Females show a more balanced approach across investment types.

2. Gender Differences:

- Females invest more in equity markets (50) compared to males (89).
- Males invest significantly more in government bonds (121) than females (65).

3. Overall Investment Distribution:
- Government bonds are the most popular investment choice (186 total), followed by equity markets (139), and mutual funds (102).

4. Risk Appetite:
- Males appear to have a lower risk appetite, favoring government bonds.
- Females show a higher risk tolerance with more balanced investments across categories.

## Task 3: Objective Analysis

𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: Analyze the relationship between savings objectives and investment choices.

My approach involved two key steps:

• Data Exploration: I used correlation analysis to examine the connections between savings goals (e.g., growing capital, planning for retirement) and investment choices (like stocks, mutual funds, government bonds). This involved creating correlation matrices and scatter plots in Power BI to visualize the relationships.

• Visual Representation: To make the findings more accessible, I designed custom charts. A standout was a clustered column chart that clearly shows which investment avenues are favored for each savings objective.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬: 

1. Investment Avenue Distribution:
- Mutual Funds and Equity are the most popular investment avenues.
- Fixed Deposits and Public Provident Fund are used less frequently.

2. Objective-Avenue Alignment:
- Capital Appreciation is strongly associated with Mutual Funds and Equity investments.
- Growth objectives are pursued through a mix of all investment types, with a slight preference for Mutual Funds.
- Income objectives are primarily met through Equity and Fixed Deposits.

3. Risk-Return Trade-off:
- Higher allocation to Mutual Funds and Equity for Capital Appreciation suggests a willingness to accept higher risk for potentially higher returns.
- The use of Fixed Deposits and Public Provident Fund for Income and Growth objectives indicates a preference for more stable, lower-risk options for these goals.

4. Objective Priorities:
- Capital Appreciation seems to be the primary focus, followed by Growth and then Income, based on the number of investments allocated to each.
