## Task 1: Data Exploration and Summary

### Objective: Understand and summarize key statistics in the dataset.

➤ 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: The journey began with importing the dataset into Power BI, laying the foundation for a comprehensive analysis. This versatile tool proved invaluable for managing and dissecting the information at hand.

➤ 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: With the data loaded, I conducted a thorough exploration to grasp its intricacies. This critical phase involved scrutinizing data structures and types, enabling me to pinpoint key variables and ensure the analysis would be both accurate and meaningful.

➤ 𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐜𝐮𝐥𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬: Leveraging insights from the examination phase, I proceeded to calculate pivotal statistics. This included determining the average age of participants, quantifying investment preferences, and identifying prevalent savings goals and some additional insights done by me to make it more relevant. These derived metrics offered a great understanding of the dataset's core characteristics.

➤ 𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: To transform raw data into compelling insights, I crafted a suite of dynamic visualizations. These carefully designed charts and graphs serve as powerful tools, making complex data patterns accessible and facilitating intuitive interpretation for viewers.

## Task 2: Gender-based Analysis

Objective: To create insightful visualizations that highlight how investment choices vary between genders.

My approach:

• Data Exploration: I began by thoroughly examining the dataset to understand the various investment options and gender distribution.

• Visualization Strategy: After careful consideration, I decided to use a combination of clustered and stacked column charts to effectively showcase the differences.

• Chart Creation: Using Power BI, I designed charts comparing investment preferences for equity, mutual funds, and government bonds across genders.

• Analysis: I spent time analyzing the visualizations to identify notable trends and differences in investment behavior between male and female investors.

Key Learnings:

- Improved my data preprocessing skills.
- Enhanced my ability to choose appropriate chart types for specific data comparisons.
- Gained insights into gender-based financial decision-making patterns.

Key Inisghts:

1. Investment Preferences:
